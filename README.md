# Modular-Organization-Terminology
This is a work-in-progress set of hyperlinked [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) of terms for [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md), [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) and [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md). 

The hyperlinked descriptions here are meant to facilitate effective communications, [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) in formal and informal [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), such as describing *claims* and proposing *agreements*, without prescribing unnecessary and potentially debilitating precision.  They're also meant to help facilitate the grassroots development of non-coercive *recipes* and technological [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md).

This terminology supports an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md), [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) based philosophy of science and language.  As a personal work of intentionally human-centered design, this terminology integrates terms for mental and social *experiences and concepts* with terms for physical concepts.  One of the key goals of this document is to facilitate more effective and consistent descriptions of apparent [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between physical, mental and social experiences.
