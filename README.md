# Modular-Organization-Terminology
This is a work-in-progress set of cross-referenced terms for modular information, organization, communication and collaboration [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md). 

The hypertextual definitions here are meant to facilitate effective but reasonably flexible communications, without prescribing excessive strictness or precision.  They're also meant to help facilitate the grassroots development of non-coercive *recipes* and *standards* for modular information, organization, communication and collaboration.

The terminology supports an action, process and systems based philosophy of science and language.  As a personal work of intentionally human-centered design, this terminology integrates terms for mental and social *experiences and concepts* with terms for physical concepts.  One of the key goals of this document is to facilitate more effective and consistent descriptions of apparent relationships between physical, mental and social experiences.
