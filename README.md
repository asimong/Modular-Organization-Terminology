# Modular-Organization-Terminology
This is a work-in-progress set of cross-referenced specifications for modular information, organization, communication and collaboration [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md). 

 These specifications are meant to enable reasonably flexible use of each term, without imparting unnecessary strict definition, and to facilitate the grassroots development of general standards for modular terminology.

This document supports an action, process and systems based philosophy of science and language.  As a personal work of intentionally human-centered design, this document integrates descriptions of physical, mental and social experiences and concepts within an intentionally minimal terminology for mental content.  One of the key goals of this document is to facilitate more effective and consistent descriptions of the apparent relationships between physical, mental and social experiences.
