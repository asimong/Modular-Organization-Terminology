# Modular-Organization-Terminology
This is an evolving [terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/terminology.md) for [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md), [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) and [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md). 

**General [Goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md):**
I [intend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) for this terminology to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitation.md) *effective* [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md), [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) in diverse [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) without prescribing unnecessary, potentially debilitating [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) or [specificity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md).  For example, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can use these terms to [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) and *claims*, and to [propose](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/proposal.md) [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md).  This terminology could also facilitate the [peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md)-to-peer development of non-[coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercion.md) [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md) and [recipes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md). Â 

**[Specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) Goal:**
I will use the linked descriptions in this repository to standardize the terminology in my [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Models) and related *documents*.

**Philosophical [Context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md):** 
This terminology supports an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md), [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) based philosophy of science and language.  These *human-centered* terms intentionally [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) experiences.  One of my [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) goals here is to help [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitation.md) more *effective* and *consistent* descriptions of such relationships.  I hope to share that goal with others via *distributed versioning* and, potentially, [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) *mergers*.

**Note: this repository will be [edited](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edit.md) frequently as terms are [interactively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [developed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md).**  

Due to this terminology's currently unstable "radioactivity", I don't yet desire to [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [license](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/license.md) it, either in whole or in part.   However, I'm very receptive to [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [requests](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/request.md) for me to [openly license](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/open-license.md) any [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) entries here.  Eventually, I intend to put the entire *master branch* here in the public domain, probably via [CCO](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) license or an equivalent license.
