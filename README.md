# Modular-Organization-Terminology
This is a work-in-progress set of cross-referenced terms for modular information, organization, communication and collaboration [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md). 

The hypertextual descriptions of these terms are meant to facilitate effective but reasonably flexible communications, without prescribing excessive strictness or precision.  They're also meant to help facilitate the grassroots development of non-coercive *recipes* and *standards* for modular information, organization, communication and collaboration.

The terms and descriptions here support an action, process and systems based philosophy of science and language.  As a personal work of intentionally human-centered design, this repository integrates descriptions of physical, mental and social *experiences and concepts* within an intentionally minimal terminology for physical content.  One of the key goals of this document is to facilitate more effective and consistent descriptions of apparent relationships between physical, mental and social experiences.

***Note: this repository will be edited quite frequently as internal hyperlinks are developed.***
