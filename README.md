# Modular-Organization-Terminology
This is a work-in-progress set of hyperlinked [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) of terms for [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md), [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) and [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md). 

**General Goals:**
The hyperlinked descriptions in this repository are meant to facilitate effective communications, [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) in diverse social [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) without prescribing unnecessary, potentially debilitating complexity or precision.  For example, thes descriptions can be used in describing [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) and *claims*, and proposing *agreements*.  The descriptions could help to facilitate the grassroots peer-to-peer development of non-coercive *recipes* and [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md).  

**Specific Goal:**
The hyperlinked descriptions in this repository will be used to standardize the use and revision of terms in my [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Models) and related documents.

**Philosophical Context:** 
This terminology supports an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md), [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) based philosophy of science and language.  These *human-centered* terms [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) *mental*, *social* and *physical* experiences.  One of my key goals here is to facilitate more effective and consistent descriptions of such relationships.  I hope to share that goal with others via distributed versioning and (hopefully) creative mergers.

***Note: this repository will be edited quite frequently as internal hyperlinks are developed.***
