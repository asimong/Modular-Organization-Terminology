A toolset is a *[set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) of [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md)* which can be used together to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [ability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md)* or to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitation.md) [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) or [composite](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/composite.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md).   

Specific *[groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of tools* within toolsets are often [functionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) as [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  However, each toolset may contain several separate systems.

Toolsets are often designed to flexibly enable or facilitate [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md), highly [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of actions.*
