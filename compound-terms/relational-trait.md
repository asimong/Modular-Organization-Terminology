A relational trait is a *[trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* between two or more [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

Relational traits may be *directional* or *mutually shared* by elements which [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) "like [peers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md)."   *(Note: This concept will be further developed.)
