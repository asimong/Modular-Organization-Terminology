A *group decision* is a *[decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md) which [emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) from a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) by different [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*. 

**Notes:**   [Group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) *group decisions* to *[commit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/commitment.md) [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) shared [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* to [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md), [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).  

It's often *un[necessary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md)* for [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of agents to make *group decisions*, when their members could (instead) separately commit resources.  However, many actions, goals and plans require a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [significant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md) amount of [investment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/investment.md) to succeed at all, or to fully realize specific [objectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/objective.md). 

Group decisions are usually [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) according to specific [recipes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md).  These recipes often include [voting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vote.md) by the [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participant.md) in a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), or the [members](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) of a group agent.

**Synonyms:**  *collective decision*
