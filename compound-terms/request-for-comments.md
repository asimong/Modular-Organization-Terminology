A request for comments (or RFC) is a [request](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/request.md) for [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to *link [descriptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/descriptive.md) commentary to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*, or to *[participate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participation.md) in dialogue* which is linked to a specific media resource.

Note:  A specific RFC may [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as an   [invitation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/invite.md) instead of a request for most [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participation.md).  However, each RFC *functions as a request* within a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
