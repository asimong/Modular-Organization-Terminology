 A *[serial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/series.md) [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* is a *[complex process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/complex-process.md) which [emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md)* from a *[set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of processes* which *each has* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[ordered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)  [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* with the serial complex process.
 
For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a specific serial complex process may emerge from the serial [performance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) of Process 1, Process 2 and *then* Process 3.
