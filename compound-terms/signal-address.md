Signal addresses are [addresses] which [identify] [signal-][destinations].
		
Signal addresses *[enable] [agents]* to send signals to two *[fundamental] [types] of destination*:
* local or remote *networking components*
  * These may include electronic displays, relays and [storage] [tools].
* *other signal addresses*  
		
**Notes**:  Each persistent signal address must be uniquely identified within each *persistent network*.  
		
Signal sources and destinations are often governed by different agents.  Each agent (using a specific identity and a compatible application) may be separately authorized to send and/or receive signals from each address.  
		
For example, one agent may be authorized to send a *video + voice signal* to an address which many other agents can simultaneously receive that signal (and other 
		signals) from.  
		
Authorization to use addresses is technically regulated by governing the distribution of *digital keys*.
		
Persistent signal addresses are often technically able to receive them at all times.  However, sending and receiving authorizations for specific agents may be granted constantly (indefinitely) or temporarily.  For instance, an application may permit a specific address to only receive video signals during a 1:00pm to 2:00 pm meeting, and specific agents may only be permitted to send audio (via microphones) at certain times during such a meeting.
