Signal addresses are [addresses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md) which *[identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [signal-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)[destinations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/desination.md)*.
		
Signal addresses *[enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* to [send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) signals to two *[basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of destination*:
* local or remote *[networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md)*
  * These may include electronic displays, relays and [storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).
* *other signal addresses*  
		
**Notes**:  Signal [sources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/source.md) and destinations are often [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) by different agents.  Each agent (using a specific identity and a [compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md) [application](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md)) may be separately [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) to send and/or [receive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) signals from each address.  
		
For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), one agent may be authorized to send a *video + voice signal* to an address which many other agents can simultaneously receive that signal (and other signals) from.  
		
Authorization to use addresses is [technically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) [regulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) by regulating the *distribution* of *digital keys*.
		
Persistent signal addresses are often technically able to receive them at all times.  However, sending and receiving authorizations for specific agents may be granted persistently *or* temporarily.  For example, an application may [permit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permission.md) a specific address to only receive video signals during a 1:00pm to 2:00 pm *meeting*, and specific agents may only be permitted to send audio (via microphones) at certain times during such a meeting.
