An RFC (or "request for comments") is a [request](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/request.md) for [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to *link [descriptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/descriptive.md) commentary to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*, or to *[participate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participation.md) in dialogue* which is linked to a specific media resource.

Note:  A specific RFC may [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as an   [invitation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/invite.md) instead of a request for most [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md).  However, each RFC *functions as a request* within a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Note: the [Internet Engineering Task Force](http://ietf.org/) uses the term RFC according to their own [unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [specification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md).  That specification is highly [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for IETF's [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md), but it's *too specific* for [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) use of the term "RFC".
