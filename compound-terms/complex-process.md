A [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) is a process which *[emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) from the [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* in a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)* of *mutually [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md)* processes.

Note: [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may additionally [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) *non-required* processes which perform *optional* [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md) functions within a complex process.
