Scale is the *proportional* [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) or *ratio* of an [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) to its [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md), or to *another* interval *within* that dimension.   

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/agent.md) often use "scale" to indicate the proportional relationship of an [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/active.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/context.md) to a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/potential.md) context, and often [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/description.md) scale vaguely and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/official.md)ly with terms such as small, medium, large or massive.
