Scale is the ratio (*proportional* [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)) of the *size of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/context.md).  

Importantly, scale often indicates the relative size of an [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/active.md) context to a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/potential.md) context.

Perceptions of scale often depend upon [ordinal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) rather than [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) comparison, and can be neither mathematical nor precise.  Therefore, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/description.md) scale vaguely and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/official.md)ly as small, medium, large or massive.

Mathematically precise scale, when possible, is the *ratio* of an interval to its [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md), or to *another* interval *within* that dimension.
