Scale is the proportional [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) (or ratio) of the *magnitude of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* to *the magnitude of a [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/context.md)* which it's considered within.  

Importantly, scale often indicates the relative size of an *[active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/active.md) context* to a *[potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/potential.md) context*.

Perceptions of scale often depend upon [ordinal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) rather than [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) comparison, and can be neither mathematical nor precise.  Therefore, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/describe.md) scale vaguely and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/official.md)ly as small, medium, large or massive.

Mathematically precise scale, when possible, is the *ratio* of an interval to its [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md), or to *another* specific interval *within* that dimension.
