A community is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* who all have the same [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) with one or more specific [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).  
 
This description can [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) refer to diverse and overlapping networks which are related through diverse resources.  However, each community can be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) according to a specific relationship with one or more *[instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) or types* of resource.
