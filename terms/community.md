A community is a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who share a clearly identifiable and significant *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* with one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).  
 
This description can [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) refer to diverse, potentially overlapping networks related through diverse, potentially overlapping resources or types of resources.  However, each community can be identified according to relationships with instances or types of resource.
 
*Note*:  I intend to add related, practical descriptions for *intentional community , project* and *organization*.
