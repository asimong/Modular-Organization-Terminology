Communication is the [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) of *transmitting* [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md).  Communication attempts to [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) *physical, mental and/or social* *experiences*.
 
Acts of communication may or may not be [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md).  Intentional acts of communication may or may not be *received* by intended *receivers* and *recipients*.
 
Communication precedes the activities of [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md), and itâ€™s crucially important in efforts to [restrict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md), *regulate* or *modify* those activities.
 
Communication often occurs through *language* and/or formatted [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md).
