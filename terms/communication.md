Communication is the [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) of transmitting ideas, utterances and/or emotions.  Communication connects physical, mental and social experiences.
 
Acts of communication may or may not be intentional.  Intentional acts of communication may or may not be received by intended recipients.
 
Communication precedes the processes of coordination, cooperation and collaboration, and itâ€™s crucially important for the regulation and adaptation of those processes.
 
Communication often occurs through intentional signals including language and/or formatted data.
