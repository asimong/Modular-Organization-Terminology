Skill is the *[dimensional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md)* of possessing *[fitness](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fitness.md) of [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) intensity* within a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.

Skills are [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can [offer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/offer.md) ans [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) to [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).  

Skills can be *[developed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) and increased* by [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md), especially when skills are used in contexts of *reasonable [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md)* including *[relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) variables*.  Such contexts can [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitation.md) the development of [adaptability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) and *improved understanding* of specific skills.
