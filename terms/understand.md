To understand is to *[accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* within a specific context.

Understanding [premises](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/premise.md) and [assumptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assume.md) is [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) to the [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) information.  (I.e., designed information *stands upon* premises and assumptions.)
