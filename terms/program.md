A program is an [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which *represents* a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of *parallel* and/or *sequential* [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md). 

Some [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md), including *bots*, are [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) to *automatically* perform programs.
