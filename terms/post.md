A post is a [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) *single* or [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [role](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md).

Post often but not always indicates a single or complex role which is *uniquely [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assignment.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

Note: *Position* and *title* are often used as synonyms of *post*.  However, those terms have other uses which are more [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) to [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md).
