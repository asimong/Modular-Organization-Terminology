Punishment is *[action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* which *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [damages](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md)* one or more agents because of [belief(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md) about their *past actions*.

Punishment is sometimes *rationalized* according to [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) such as *retribution* and/or *deterrence*.
 
Punishment differs deeply from concepts such as *remediation* and *restorative justice*.
