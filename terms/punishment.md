Punishment is *harm* which is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) *caused* by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to agents because of *perceptions* of their past [action(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md).
 
Punishment is sometimes *rationalized* according to [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) such as *retribution* and/or *deterrence*.
 
Punishment differs deeply from concepts such as *remediation* and *restorative justice*.
