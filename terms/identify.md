*To identify* is the [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of [assigning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) one or more [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md), including [names](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md) and [relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) properties, to [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). 

Identification is especially associated with assigning properties such as (constant) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) or *[variable-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md)type: [value](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md)/name* to *perceived* or [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of those type.
