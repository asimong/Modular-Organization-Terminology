To identify is to *[assign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)*-- [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) including [names](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md) and *[relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md)*-- to an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

Identification is especially associated with assigning traits such as ([constant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/constant.md)) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) or *[variable-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md)type: [value](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md)/name* to *perceived* or [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of those type.
