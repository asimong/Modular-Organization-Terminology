Direct actions often seem to occur quickly or instantly, but can occur over any [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), water can directly dissolve many [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [substances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substance.md) (even highly resistant ones) over extended periods.
