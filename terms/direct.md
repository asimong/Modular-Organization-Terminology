*To direct* is to *[describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* for a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of [transportation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md)*.  

*Direct* is a [relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md) of all [interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) which *do not [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) through intermediate [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.
		
Direct actions often seem to occur quickly or instantly, but can occur over any [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), water can directly dissolve many [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [substances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substance.md) (even highly resistant ones) over extended periods.
