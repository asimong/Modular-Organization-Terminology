A recipe is a [formula](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/formula.md) which *one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [recommends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md)* for *[performing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*, often within a specific [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) or [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) such as a social [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) or [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md).

**Notes:** 

Recipes are often [included](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) in the [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) of specific networks.  

Networks often [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [comment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/comment.md) upon or [evaluate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/evaluate.md) specific recipes.
