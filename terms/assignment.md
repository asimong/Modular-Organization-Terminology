Assignment is the [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which *[creates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) an [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)*.

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) often assign [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) or [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).  Such assignment of agents is a type of *delegation*.
