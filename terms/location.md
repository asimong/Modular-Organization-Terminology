Location is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) an [element's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) *or* the [interval(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) it occupies *within a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)*.

Location(s) may be *strictly* [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) or [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) in some [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).  However, **locations can contain  [interval(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of any size**, within any number of [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) dimensions.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a huge three-dimensional *area* of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) *space* can be identified with the location of the planet Earth.

See also the stricter term [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md).

Note: This [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) is especially abstract, for technical reasons.  It will probably need more examples.
