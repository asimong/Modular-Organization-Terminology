"Personal" is an adjectival [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) for [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) or [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which are specific to *individual* [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md). 

By contrast, the common terms “personal relationship” and "personal business" often (but not always) refer to *interpersonal* (i.e., [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md)) elements which *form between* agents.  Such informal and vague usage also often (but not always) implies that those interpersonal interactions are *private*.
