A goal is a future [state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) *desired* by one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  [Officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) goals are sometimes described as *objectives*.
 
Each goal can be identified with [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which [creates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md), *maintains*, [governs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md), [transforms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md), *eliminates* or [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [damages](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) and agents. Thus, goals always relate to [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) with [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).  However, major goals often requires unpredictable creative activity, which makes it practically impossible to accomplish them *automatically* via [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).

Importantly, the [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) pursuit of creative goals often [requires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) highly predictable  [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which *can* be automated.
 
Individuals often engage in the solitary pursuit of [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) goals.  Shared goals are often the subject of [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md), [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economic.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) including [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md), [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md). 
 
Shared goals may often include creatively co-exploring ideas and shared interests *without* attempting to reach mutually shared conclusions.  This is the generic nature of a ‘discussion [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md)’, and of many other social [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) and [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md).
