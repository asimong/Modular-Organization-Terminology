A goal is a future [state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) *desired* by one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  Formally [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) and [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) *pursued* goals are sometimes described as *objectives*.
 
Each goal relates to the [creation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md), support, [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md), *transformation* or destruction of one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) and agents. Thus, goals always relate to [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which *require* [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and *intend* to create [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).  However, major goals often requires unpredictable creative activity, which makes it practically impossible to pursue them as predictably detailed processes.  

Importantly, the unpredictable pursuit of creative goals often results in the [emergence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) of highly predictable *sequential* or *parallel* sub-goal [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
 
Individuals often engage in the solitary pursuit of [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) goals.  Shared goals are often the subject of [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md), [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economic.md) and [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) including [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md), [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md). 
 
Shared goals may often include creatively co-exploring ideas and shared interests *without* attempting to reach mutually shared conclusions.  This is the generic nature of a ‘discussion group’, and of many [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) and online [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md).
