A goal is a future state or condition desired by one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  Formally identified and intentionally pursued goals are sometimes described as *objectives*.
 
Each goal relates to the creation, support, regulation, transformation or destruction of one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) and agents. Thus, goals always relate to [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which *require* [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and *intend* to create [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).  However, major goals often requires unpredictable creative activity, which makes it practically impossible to pursue them as predictably detailed processes.  

Importantly, the unpredictable pursuit of creative goals often results in the emergence of highly predictable, required sub-goals or “tasks”. 
 
Individuals often engage in the solitary pursuit of personal goals.  Shared goals are often the subject of social, cultural, economic and political organization. 
 
Shared goals may often include creatively co-exploring ideas and shared interests *without* attempting to reach mutually shared conclusions.  This is the generic nature of a ‘discussion group’, and of many digital networks and communities.
