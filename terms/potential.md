A potential [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) is one which seems clearly possible or in one or more related contexts, regardless of whether it is or isnâ€™t [actual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/actual.md) in a specific context.
 
For instance, an element which is potential right *now* may become actual in the *future*.
