Potential is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of all [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which clearly could *be or become [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) present* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes:**  Active elements are always [members](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) of any ([accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) and comprehensive) [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of potential elements for a specific context (such as a [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) of [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md)).  However, many potentials *aren't* active.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an element which is potential right *now* may, or may not, become active in the *future*.

**Synonyms:** *possible*
