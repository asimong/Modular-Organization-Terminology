Potential is a [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which clearly could *be or become [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) present* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Active elements are always [members](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) of any ([accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) and comprehensive) [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of potential elements for a specific context.  However, many potentials *aren't* active.  (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an element which is potential right *now* may, or may not, become active in the *future*.)
