A potential [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) is one which seems clearly possible or [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in one or more [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) which are clearly related to the *current* context.

Active elements are always [members](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) of any (accurate, inclusive) [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of potentials.  However, many potentials aren't active.  (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an element which is potential right *now* may, or may not, become active in the *future*.)
