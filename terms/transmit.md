*To transmit* is to [transport](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) a [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md).

[Sources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/source.md) often *store* transmitted signals.  Thus, transmission often causes *replication* of stored signals at the [destination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destination.md).

Importantly, addresses can [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitation.md) *simultaneous* [transmission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmission.md) of [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) to large [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) agents.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a signal can be easily transmitted to all [members](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/member.md) of a [group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group-agent.md)
