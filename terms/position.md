A position is the *location of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* within a *[relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*, such as (but not limited to) the *[dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md)*. 

The position of elements may be rather *strictly* [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) or [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) in some contexts, and loosely [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) or even ir[relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) in others.
