A value is an [instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of a [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

*Note:*  The [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of "value" is often [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) limited to *[conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) value* within the *[dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of desirability*  of [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to specific [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agents.md).  For instance, this seems to be be approximately the use of the term "value" in the [Value Flows](https://www.valueflo.ws/) vocabulary, which is mildly [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to this [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology).
