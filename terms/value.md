A value is an [instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of a [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

*Note:*  The [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of "value" is often [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) limited to *[conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) value* within the [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of *desirability  of [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agents.md)*.  For instance, this seems to be be approximately the use of the term "value" in [Value Flows](https://www.valueflo.ws/).
