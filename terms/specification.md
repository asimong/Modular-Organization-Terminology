A specification is a strict [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) of a [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which describes its required and (sometimes) recommended [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) within a [technological](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

A specification does *not* try to describe all potential properties of the instances of a type.  It tends to focus upon what *must* and/or *must not* be present in each instance.

Specifications can be created by anyone for any reason.  See also [standard](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md).
