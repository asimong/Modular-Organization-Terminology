A specification is an *[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md)* of a [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which describes its [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) and (sometimes) [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md) [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) within an official [technological] [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

A specification does *not* try to (impossibly) [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) all  properties of the [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of a type.  It tends to focus upon properties which *must* and/or *must not* be [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in each instance.

Specifications can be created by any [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) for any reason.  See also [standard](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md).
