A specification is a strict description of a type of form or element, including all entities and “objects”, which describes required and (sometimes) optionally desired properties of instances of that type.   

Specifications typically describe what must or must not be present in an instance of a specified type.

Specifications can be created by anyone for any reason.  See also standard.
