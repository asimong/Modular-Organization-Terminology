A specification is a strict description of a [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which describes required and (sometimes) optionally desired [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of instances of that type.   

Specifications do *not* try to describe or define all potential properties of a type.  They tend to focus upon what *must* and/or *must not* be present in each instance of the type.

Specifications can be created by anyone for any reason.  See also standard.
