A property is a trait or behavior which is *potentially* or *actually* exhibited by a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md). 
 
Most properties are clearly determined *relatively* by *interactions* within identifiable contexts.
