A property is a [relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a "behavior" ([interactivity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)) of *another* element within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/form.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

[Participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/participation.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/agent.md) may [believe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md) that [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) properties are [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in most if not all [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) contexts for the elements which those properties have been *attached* to.  However, only the most [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) and [accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) properties may approach that  *ideal* of *universality*.   

Many properties of *[language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) elements*, including all [representational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) elements, are definitive/tautological [designs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).  By contrast, claims of [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) properties are developed [uncertainly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) through the [conception](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of [patterns](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/pattern.md) and [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md).  Such conceived properties are technically *attributes* which can't be indisputably "proven".  However, some such attributes may be *consistently and [usefully](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [agreed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md) upon* by all agents within a specific context.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), almost all (awake) [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) seem to predictably *[experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) weight* as a property of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) *matter* (more accurately, *matter-energy*) within a *gravitational* *field*.
 
Properties can be conceived and [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) by identifying significantly interactive relationships between elements.
