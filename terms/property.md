A property is a [relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a "behavior" ([interactivity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)) of *another* element within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/form.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

[Participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/participation.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/agent.md) may [believe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md) that [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) properties are [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in most if not all [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) contexts for the elements which those properties have been applied to.  However, only the most [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) and [representative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) properties may approach such "universality".   

Many properties of verbal and visual *language*, including all representations, are definitive/tautological [designs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).  By contrast, claims of [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) or *empirical* properties are developed *uncertainly* and *subjectively*, through repeated identification of perceived [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md).  Such properties are technically *attributes* which can't be indisputably "proven".  However, some such attributes may be *consistently* [agreed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md) upon by all agents within a specific context.  (For instance, almost all human agents seem to predictably perceive *weight* as a property of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) *matter* (more accurately, *matter-energy*) within a *gravitational* *field*.)
 
Properties can be [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) and described according to significantly influential [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between elements.
