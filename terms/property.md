A property is a trait or behavior which is [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) or [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) exhibited by a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md). 

Empirical properties are perceived through recurrent association of perceived forms and elements.  They can't be indisputably "proven", but they may (in some cases) be consistently agreed upon by all agents within an clearly identifiable [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  (For instance, almost all of us seem to predictably perceive weight as a property of physical matter within a field of gravitational force.)
 
Properties can be perceived, and described, according to significantly influential [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between forms and elements.
