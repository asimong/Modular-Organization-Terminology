*To telecommunicate* is *to [communicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) in[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) by [transmitting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) one or more electronic [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)* via a *signalling [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)*.  

**Notes:**  *Telecommunications* [tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to be associated with the transmission of signals which [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) *visual and/or audio* [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md).  However, *[digital] networking* including the World Wide Web is telecommunicative.

Telecommunications *[enables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [live](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/live.md) communications at long [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) distances*, outside of the *range* of human *sensory organs*.  However, people can (and increasingly do) telecommunicate within the range of potential direct physical signaling.
