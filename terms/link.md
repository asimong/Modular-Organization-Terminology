The [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md) of *link* is a [subtype](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subtype.md) of the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *[connect](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/connect.md)*.   However, it's still a [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) term with frequently [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) subtypes of its own, such as *[hyperlink](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hyperlink.md)*.
