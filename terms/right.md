A right is a *social* [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), often [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) in an [agreement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md), which *declares* that [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) in an identifiable [role](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) will have the [agency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agency.md) to *use* (and in some cases, potentially damage or consume) an identified *[instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) or [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md)* of resource.  

This intentionally broad definition of 'right' can include, for instance, the right for members or guests to participate in [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md)-supported discussions or [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) of any type.
