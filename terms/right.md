This intentionally broad definition of 'right' can include, for instance, the right for members or guests to participate in [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md)-supported [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) of any type.
