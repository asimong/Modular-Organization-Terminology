*Subject* is a *[relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* which *[identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) element which another element has been [formally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) related to*. 
		
Subjects are often [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  However, the term subject is not usually [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) to agents (or to organisms) except within the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of [experimental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experiment.md) [research](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/research.md).

In [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), *subject* often [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) a *[description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) of a [topic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/topic.md)*, which may (or may not) supplement a *[title](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/title.md)*.
