A *node* is an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/element.md) where two or more [paths](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/path.md) meet (or at least [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/potential.md) meet) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/specific.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/network.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/context.md). 

**Notes:**  

Nodes often [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/perform.md) [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/base.md) [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/importance.md) networking [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/function.md).

To perform functions upon [transported](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/transport.md) elements, nodes may *[modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/modify.md) or [replace](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/replace.md)* a specific *pathway [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/element.md)* for each path which meets at the node.   Nodes can replace pathway elements when necessary by [providing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/provide.md) [interfaces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/interface.md) which [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/enable.md) them to [receive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/receive.md) transported elements as [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/inputs.md), to perform functions upon them, and to [send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/send.md) those elements onward as [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/outputs.md) which are [compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/compatible.md) with the pathing [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/require.md).
