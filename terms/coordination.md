Coordination is a *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) (or [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of actions)* which *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [relates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* two or more [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)-- often, [agents'](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) or [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)-- to support a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).  
 
Note: the goal of coordination may be to [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) specific [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md).  For instance, the activities of two or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may be [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [transformed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md) to reduce [conflict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md) or risky [competition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/competition.md).
 
Coordination often occurs un[officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md).  However, [group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) may [assign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) coordination [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) to [subgroups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subgroup.md) or to [personal agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal-agent.md).  Note: a coordination [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) (or any *other* function) which is assigned to a subgroup often becomes [collaborative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) work within the subgroup.
