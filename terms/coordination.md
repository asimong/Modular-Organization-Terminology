Coordination is [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) between [identifiable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identifiable.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)-- often, [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) or [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)-- to support one or more specific [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).  
 
Note: mutually shared goals may, importantly, include the reduction or elimination of identifiable harm(s).  (For instance, the actions of two or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may be intentionally *differentiated* to reduce *conflict* or unnecessary *competition*.)
 
Coordination often occurs informally.  However, *group agents* may assign coordination responsibilities to individuals or to subgroup agents.  Note: a coordination [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) (or any *other* function) which is assigned to a subgroup becomes [collaborative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) work within the subgroup.
