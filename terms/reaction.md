Reaction is the [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which is [specifically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *caused by* one or more other actions.
 
Action and reaction may be clearly and usefully [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) in [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) of relatively [simple](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) [serial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/series.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).  However, most reactions are part of [parallel complex processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parallel-complex-process.md) which may simultaneously influence all acting [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), including any [participating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participation.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  Nonetheless, agents may distinguish “actions” and “reactions” to *limit* [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) and to *prioritize* *emphases* in [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) within a context's [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) or [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md).
