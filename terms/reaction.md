Reaction is the [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which is [specifically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *caused by* one or more other actions.
 
Action and reaction may be clearly defined in relatively simple [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) of *sequential* [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).  However, most reactions are part of [interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) which [measurably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measurable.md) influence all acting [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) including any [participating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participation.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  Nonetheless, we may distinguish “actions” and “reactions” to create simplicity and *prioritized* *emphases* in [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) such as an [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) *level of detail*.
