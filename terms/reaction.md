Reaction is [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which is *caused by other [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) action(s)*.
 
*Action-reaction [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* can sometimes be *[usefully](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md)* in [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which contain *[serial complex processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/serial-complex-process.md)*.  However, most reactions are part of [parallel complex processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parallel-complex-process.md) which  simultaneously influence all acting [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), including any [participating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participation.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), in potentially *unpredictable* ways.  Nonetheless, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may identify “actions” and “reactions” to *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md)* and to *[prioritize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/priority.md) elements* within specific [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
