Generic (or general) is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) which [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that the [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) is an *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md)*.
