*To distribute* is *to [locate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md) [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) justly* throughout *a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) locations* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
	
**Notes:** 
		
Elements may be *distributed* according to *[qualitative variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/qualitative-variable.md)* or *[dimensional variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/dimensional-variable.md)*.
		
[Dimensionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) distributed elements will *be [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) diversely* across a specific dimension or [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md).
	
**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [Meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md):** *To distribute* often especially means *to locate [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) fairly throughout a set of potentially assigned [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

*Distributed [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)* [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that *[signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [processing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* are located fairly throughout the sets of potential agents and networked *signaling [devices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).*
