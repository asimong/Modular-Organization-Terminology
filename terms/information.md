Information consists of [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) and [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *are present* or *hold meaning* within one or more identifiable [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*Note: My much longer description of "information" elsewhere is gradually being updated.  It's difficult to create a root definition which accurately and sufficiently [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) and [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) information.*
