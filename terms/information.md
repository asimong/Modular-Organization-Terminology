Information consists of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) and [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which *are [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) present* or *hold semantic content* (i.e., *meaning*) within one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*Note: My much longer description of "information" elsewhere is gradually being updated.  It's difficult to create a root definition which accurately and sufficiently [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) and [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) information.*
