Analog is a *[trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* which *[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) other information*.  

**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) meaning:** In [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [processing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), *analog* especially [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) *[data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) which represents continuously [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)*.  Such analog data does not represent with *perfect [accuracy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md)*.  Its limited accuracy [degrades](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/degrade.md) through increased *distortion* and [noise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/noise.md) when it is repeatedly [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) or [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md).
