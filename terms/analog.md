Analog is a [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) with one or more *continuously [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md)* [dimensional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md).

Analog [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) does not represent with *perfect accuracy*.  Its limited accuracy *degrades* through *distortion* and *noise* when it is repeatedly [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) or *reproduced*.
