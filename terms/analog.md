Analog is a *[trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md)* which [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) one or more *continuously [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [dimensions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)*.

Analog [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) does not represent with *perfect [accuracy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md)*.  Its limited accuracy [degrades](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/degrade.md) through increased *distortion* and [noise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/noise.md) when it is repeatedly [transmitted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) or [replicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/replicate.md).
