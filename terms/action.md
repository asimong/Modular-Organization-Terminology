Action is *identifiable change* in organizational [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) and/or [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), such as [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) and [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  

Action can often be perceived as gradual change over time.  However, action may sometimes be perceived as a sudden shift between discrete states within existing forms and elements.  Action may also be perceived as the creative emergence or destruction of forms or elements.

*An action* is a discretely identified change.  Gradually occurring change may be discretely identified by indicating qualitative parameters.  (For instance, many physical and chemical reactions will asymptotically approach a state which is practically identical to dynamic equilibrium.)

Discretely identified actions are often perceived to be reactions to causes outside of the reacting form(s) or element(s).  This is especially common when the perceived causes are [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who make conscious choices to perform actions.  (Such consciously chosen actions are often referred to as acts.) 

Most actions and reactions are part of interactions which influence all of the interacting elements, including agents.  However, we rarely bother to fully identify and describe interactions, partly for these important reasons:  

1. Agents, and many other complex systems, are closely related to regulation and repair systems which enable them to create significant action without deeply influencing their identifiable properties.  (These regulating and repair systems may sometimes be distinguished as subsystems or as external support systems.)

2. Many interactions occur between elements of such vastly different scales that it seems practically impossible, and unimportant, to distinguish significant changes in all of the acting elements.  

For instance, it’s practically impossible and unimportant (to humans, so far) to identify the influence of an accelerating automobile upon the position of the Earth, which technically does have an “equal and opposite” inertial reaction.  

Likewise, it’s practically impossible to determine the constant but subtle (tidal) influence of the moon’s gravity upon a puddle.  

On a closely related note, many abundant and easily accessed resources, such as oxygen for respiration, are generally taken for granted (and ignored) by most if not all agents within a specific context.

Most actions can be clearly described with types including *transformation, creation, transportation, transmission* and *transfer*.
