Action is *influence* which [creates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md), *destroys, [changes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md)* and/or *sustains* [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) and/or [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) *over an [identifiable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identifiable.md) [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of time*.

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may be directly identified with "action" via [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md). 

Action may be perceived gradually and indistinctly, *or* it may be perceived through a discrete "quantum" shift between the *presence or absence* of forms, elements or [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md).   Gradual, indistinct action can be described by establishing periods of time during which identifiable action occurred. 

Most actions and [reactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reaction.md) can be clearly identified within a context of [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md).  However, we rarely bother to thoroughly describe interactions, partly for these practical reasons:  

1. Agents, and many other complex systems, are closely related to regulation and repair systems which enable them to create significant action without deeply influencing their identifiable properties.  (These regulating and repair systems may sometimes be distinguished as *subsystems* or as external *support systems*.)

2. Many interactions occur between elements of such vastly different scales that it seems practically impossible, and unimportant, to distinguish significant changes in all of the acting elements.  

For instance, it’s practically impossible and unimportant (to humans, so far) to identify the influence of an accelerating automobile upon the position of the Earth, which technically does have an “equal and opposite” inertial reaction.  

Likewise, it’s practically impossible to determine the constant but subtle (tidal) influence of the moon’s gravity upon a puddle.  

On a closely related note, many abundant and easily accessed resources, such as oxygen for respiration, are generally taken for granted (and ignored) by most if not all agents within a specific context.

Actions can be clearly described with [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) including *transformation, creation, destruction, emergence, transportation, transmission* and *transfer*.   (Entries to be added.)
