Action is [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) which *[changes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* by [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md), [sustaining](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md), [developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md), [transforming](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md), [damaging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) or [destroying](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md) them over a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md)*.

**Notes:**  [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may directly [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) or *be identified with* "acts" or "actions" via [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Action may be *perceived* vaguely and gradually *or* through discrete "quantum" shifts between the *presence* or *absence* of elements, forms or [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md).  Gradual action can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by identifying intervals of time *during which* [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) action occurred. 

Most actions and [reactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reaction.md) can be clearly identified within a larger context of [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) simultaneous [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md).  However, agents rarely bother to thoroughly describe interactions, partly for these practical reasons:  

1. Agents, and many other complex *adaptive* [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), are closely related to [regulation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) and *repair* systems which enable them to create significant action *without* deeply influencing their specific traits.  (These regulating and repair systems may sometimes be distinguished as [subsystems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subsystem.md) or as external *support systems*.)

2. Many interactions occur between elements of such vastly different [scales](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) that it seems practically impossible-- and unimportant-- to identify significant changes in most of the interacting elements.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), it’s unimportant (to humans, so far) to identify the influence of an *accelerating* automobile upon the *velocity* of the Earth, which technically does have an “equal and opposite” *inertial* reaction.  Likewise, it’s unimportant to determine the  *microscopic* (tidal) influence of the moon’s gravity upon a puddle.  

On a closely related note, many *abundant* and *easily [accessed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)* resources, such as oxygen for respiration, are generally taken for granted (and ignored) by most if not all agents within specific contexts.

Actions can be clearly described with [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) (see also [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)), including [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) types such as [transformation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transform.md), [creation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md), destruction, [emergence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md), [transportation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md), [transmission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md), [transfer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transfer.md) and [transaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transaction.md).
