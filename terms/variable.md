*A variable* is a *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/type.md) of [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* which could [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/potential.md) contain [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/instance.md) which *differ importantly within the [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/active.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.   

Frequently, variables are [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/identified.md) in the context of change over an [identifiable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/identifiable.md) *[interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of time*.   

The active [value](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) of variables may vary *semantically/qualitatively/nominally*, *ordinally* or by interval.
