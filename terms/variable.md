*A variable* is an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) with one or more [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) which can *change* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), including an [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of *time*.   

Variables may vary *semantically/qualitatively/nominally* or they may vary *mathematically* by *order*, interval or *ratio*.

"Variable" can also be *assigned* as a property of a specific element.
