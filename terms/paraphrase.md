*To paraphrase* is *to [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) representation* by *re-[form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)ing* it with different [descriptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).
		
Paraphrasing is [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md), *inductive* and *questionable*.  However, it can greatly increase the [opportunity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md) for [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) mutually shared [understandings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understanding.md) and [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md) in common [languages](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).
