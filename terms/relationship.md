Relationship is *interactivity* between [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within one or more [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Relationship can be described or defined via [semantic triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) which establish mutually influential (but often assymmetrical) [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) in two or more forms and/or elements.
