"Relationship" is [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) *[described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) as a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.

Relationship can be perceived and described via [semantic triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) which identify mutually influential [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  Such semantic triples may be perceived, and assigned, as [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) for specific elements.
