Relationship is *identifiable interactivity* between [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md), [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) or [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) within one or more contexts.

Relationship can be described or defined via [semantic triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) which establish mutually responsible (but possibly assymmetrical) properties in two or more forms and/or elements.
