Relationship is *[grouping](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) and/or [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)* as a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

Relationships can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) through *semantic triples* which *link*  [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) via *relational elements* which [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/identify.md) groups or interactivity.

Relationship can also [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/emerge.md) *or* be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/design.md) through the [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) of descriptive [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) for related elements.
