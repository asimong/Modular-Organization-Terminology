Relationship is *mutually dependent* [interactivity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) between [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) and/or [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within one or more clearly identifiable [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Relationship can be perceived and described via [semantic triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) which identify *mutually influential* forms and/or elements.  (Such semantic triples may be perceived and assigned as context-specific [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) for related forms and/or elements.)
