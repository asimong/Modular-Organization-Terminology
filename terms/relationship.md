Relationship is *[grouping](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) and/or [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)* as a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

Relationships can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) through *semantic triples* which *link*  [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) via *relational elements* which *[identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/identify.md) groups (including [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)) and/or interactions*.

Relationship can also *[emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/emerge.md)* or *be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/design.md)* through the [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) of descriptive [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of apparently related elements.
