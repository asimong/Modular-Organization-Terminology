Relationship is *[typification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) and/or [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)* [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) as a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

Relationship can be described through *semantic triples* which *link* two [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) via a *relational element* which [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/identify.md) types, [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) or interactivity.

Relationship can also [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/emerge.md) or be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/design.md) through the [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) of descriptive [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) for related elements.
