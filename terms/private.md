Private is a [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of *[action(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* which occur in [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md). 

Likewise, private is a property of [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) which *one or more* [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participation.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) restrict*.

Note that private actions *may* (or may not) directly lead to *non-private*/public information.
