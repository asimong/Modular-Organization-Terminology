A substance is a [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md) which is *very predictable and stable* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes:** substances are often perceived as "material", "objects" or "things".  However, they can be directly [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) with (often [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)) forces.

Substances are [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) but they can often (like most elements) be identified more [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) as [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).
