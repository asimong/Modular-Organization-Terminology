A motivation is a [belief](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md), [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or *emotion* which *causes* or *co-causes* a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) (and possibly [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md)) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) in an identifiable [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  
 
Motivations are closely related to [intentions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md).  However, motivations may often remain indefinitely unconscious.
