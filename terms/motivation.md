A motivation is a [belief](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md), [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or *emotion* which may *cause* or *co-cause* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) in one or more [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
 
Motivations are closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to [intentions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md).  However, motivations often remain *indefinitely unconscious*.
