A dimension is a [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) which *can [vary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md)* in ways which [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) *number*, *intensity*, or variation between the *polar binary* of *presence-absence*.

Dimensions often vary within [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), *presence-absence* varies within the *inherent* limits of 1 and 0 (or 100% and 0%).

[Active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [values](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) within some dimensions may be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) *only* by [order](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md).  In other dimensions, values may be identified by [intervals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md), *ratios* and [scales](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md). 

Note: this [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) will need [examples](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md) which describe some of the many *non-[physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md)* dimensions which constantly influence [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md).
