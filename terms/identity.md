An identity is a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) which *represents* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identifiable.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within an [informational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Identities are often *verbal* [names](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md).  However, they may consist of any [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of data sets including *alphanumeric* or *binary* *strings*.
