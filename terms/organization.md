Organization is the development or presence of [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).  
 
Organization may emerge naturally, or through accidental or [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

Additionally, indications of the presence of organization refer quite frequently to either types or instances of organization.  Therefore, the use of this term must be further specified or semantically linked.   *work-in-progress*
