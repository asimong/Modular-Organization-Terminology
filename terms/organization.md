Organization is the *[emergence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) and/or [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md)* of [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md). 

The term "organization" frequently refers to both the *presence* and [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) of forms.  Additionally, organization often refers to either [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) or [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of forms.  Therefore, this term provides little [communicative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [value](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md) unless its use or its intended [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) are further [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md).
