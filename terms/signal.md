A signal is a *[field](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/field.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)  which [transmits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)*.

Signals often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [signs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sign.md), but may also consist of direct (non-sign, non-symbolic) information.
