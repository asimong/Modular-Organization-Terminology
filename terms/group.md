A group is any *combination of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* which *each* has one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationships.md) within the combination. 

**Group is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) term which *includes* all [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md), [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) and [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).**  

Each group of elements can be more [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as a *set or network* at a specific [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) of [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md).
