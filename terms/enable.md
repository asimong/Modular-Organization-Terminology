To enable is to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) an [ability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md)*, or to *[activate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) ability*.

Note:  Enabling an ability doesn't necessarily create *[capacity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/capacity.md) or [opportunity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md)* to use that ability.  (See also [agency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agency.md).)
