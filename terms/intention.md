Intentions are *[plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)*.
 
**Notes:** 

*Intentional actions* are actions by agents who seem to be (or to *have been*) *consciously [motivated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/motivation.md)* by one or more specific intentions. 
 
Note: conscious motivations arenâ€™t necessarily the only, or main, motivations for specific actions.
