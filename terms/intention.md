Intentions are [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) to perform specific [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or to achieve specific [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).
 
*Intentional* actions seem to be (or to *have been*) *consciously motivated* by one or more specific intentions. 
 
Note: conscious motivations arenâ€™t necessarily the only, or main, motivations for specific actions.
