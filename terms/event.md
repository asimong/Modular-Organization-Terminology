An event is an [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of *time* during which [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md), [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) and/or [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) are [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md).
 
*Note:* I specify events quite differently than Value Flows and other REA economic modeling systems do.  I will consider a different approach, but I believe that the term “event” is much more flexibly useful by associating it with special conditions than by identifying it with economic [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md).
