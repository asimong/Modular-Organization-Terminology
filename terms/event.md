An event is a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)*, or *[group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of activities*, which occurs during a specific *[interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md)*.
 
Note: The [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *event* is [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for [designing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) and [planning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)*.  However, it can also be useful for *[performing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) and [reporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md)* specific *[instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md)* of action.
