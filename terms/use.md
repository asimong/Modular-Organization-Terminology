"Useful" is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of all [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which *can [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as inputs* in a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)*.

It's also practically synonymous with [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) use of the term *utility* in professional [economics](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md).
