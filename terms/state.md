*To state* is *to [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md)* one or more *[perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
		
**Notes:**  *State* is more [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) than the closely related term *indicate*.  Most [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)  *state* more often than they *indicate*, even in contexts where statements are highly questionable.
		
**Synonyms:**  *declare*

**Other [Forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md):**  *A state* may [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) a *[set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [values](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/value.md)* for one or more [variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).   (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a pot of heating may reach the *state* of 100 degrees Celsius temperature and *boiling*.)
