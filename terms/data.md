Data is [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) which [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and/or agents' [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) have organized according to one or more specific [formats](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md).  
 
Data may [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) any [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of information, but typically reproduces or represents (re-presents) *media* such as written language, visual and/or acoustic information.  
 
*Digital* data is encoded as units, sequences and sets of *data [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  Each type of data element represents an intentionally informative element in a data format.  

Some data elements could be considered either simple (atomic) or compound objects, depending on the level of detail at which complexly formatted data is viewed.  For example, each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet is a simple element in written language, but can be digitally encoded as a compound sequence of bits via the Unicode standard.
