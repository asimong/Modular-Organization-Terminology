Data is [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) which [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and/or *devices* have organized, either implicitly or explicitly, according to one or more specific *formats*.  Formats [coordinate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) data with an intended [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
 
Data can represent any [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of information, but typically reproduces or represents (re-presents) *media* such as written language, visual and/or acoustic information.  
 
Data is encoded as units, sequences and sets of *data [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  Each data element uniquely represents a type of readable, intentionally informative input into a signal.  Each unique instance of a data element within a signal is a datum.  This term is rarely used, because information is perceived, structured and processed by using scalar variables (including words and decimal numbers) in data fields and formats such as documents and databases.
 
Some data elements could be considered either simple (atomic) or compound objects, depending on the level of detail at which complexly formatted data is viewed.  For example, each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet is a simple element in written language, but can be digitally encoded as a compound sequence of bits via the Unicode standard.
