Data is [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) within a specific [format](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md).  
 
Data can be any [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of information, but typically is [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md). 
 
*Digital* data is encoded as units, sequences and sets of *data [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  Each type of data element represents an intentionally informative element in a data format.  

Some data elements could be considered either simple (atomic) or compound objects, depending on the level of detail at which complexly formatted data is viewed.  For example, each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet is a simple element in written language, but can be digitally encoded as a compound sequence of bits via the Unicode standard.
