A network is a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which share the [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of each being (either *directly* or *indirectly*) [identifiably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identifiable.md) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to every other element.

When referring to groups of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), this description of network is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) more general and flexible than "*[community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md), project* or [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md)" which may [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) as a *group agent*.
