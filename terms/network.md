A network is a group of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which are all identifiably [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to each other, at least indirectly, within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

When referring to groups of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), this description of network is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) more general and flexible than *community, project* or *organization (as a noun)*.
