A network is a *[set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* which each *have the [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md)* of being (either directly *or* indirectly) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to each other element in the set.

When referring to *[groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*, this description of network is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) more *[generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and flexibly [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md)* than the diverse *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md)* (including *[communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) and projects*) which may [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) *[group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)*.

*Note:* [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) could [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) an *un[limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md)ed* number of networks, so it's often *important* to focus *attention* on [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) networks.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), agents often identify networks which *[name](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/name.md) or [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md)* important [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and systemic [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
