A network is a [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) in which every [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) has an identified [interactive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md), at least indirectly, with every other element. 

When referring to groups of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), this description of network is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) more general and flexible than *community, project* or *organization (as an agent)*.
