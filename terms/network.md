A network is a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which share the [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of each being either *directly* or *indirectly* [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to each other element.

When referring to groups of [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), this description of network is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) more [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and flexible than any "*[community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md), project* or [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md)" which may [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) as a [group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) could [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a *limit*less number of networks, so it's important to focus *attention* on contextually [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) networks.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), agents often identify networks which *name* or [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) *important* [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and systemic [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
