Cost is [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [damages](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md), *destroys* or *removes* [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) from a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) as a [risk](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) *or* [requirement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md).

Potential actions may be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by [describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) their potential costs. [Reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) of *past* actions may describe cost(s) which were *sensed* or directly [measured](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md).
