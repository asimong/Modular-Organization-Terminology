Cost is a [relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) indicating that an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) *destroys* or *decreases* [agency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agency.md), [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) and/or [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) of one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Potential actions may be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by [describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) their potential costs. [Reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) of *past* actions may describe cost(s) which were *sensed* or directly [measured](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md).
