A plan is a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *future* [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or *[group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of actions* which is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) *[supported](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md)* by one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  

Each plan supports one or more [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).
 
Plans may (or may not) be flexibly [adaptable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) to [changing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) [states](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md).  See also [decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md) and [commitment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/commitment.md).
