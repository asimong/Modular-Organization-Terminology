Physical is a [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) and [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which can be *reliably [experienced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md)* and [agreed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md) on by *rational [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*, *and* [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *recorded* by *sensor* [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) which agents [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md), within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) of [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md).
