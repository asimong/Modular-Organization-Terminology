Reports are [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) of [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md), [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) including *complex* *efforts* to pursue [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and to satisfy the *requirements* of [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md).  
 
Reports can include simple *claims*:  short *declarative* descriptions of actions.  By contrast, complex reports are usually written as interpretive *narratives* which *intermittently* refer to [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md), including [measurements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) and *recordings*.
