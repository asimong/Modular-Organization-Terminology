Relevance is a *[relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)* which [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) the perceived *[accuracy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) of [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) to a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). 

Relevance can often be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) according to the [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) that an element which is [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) in a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of context* will be [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in *specific [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of that type*.
