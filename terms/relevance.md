Relevance is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) the perceived *intensity* of [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) to a [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). 

Relevance can be *identified* according to the *perceived* *probability* that an element which is [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) in a [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of context will be [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of that type.
