Relevance is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) the perceived *intensity* of [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) to a [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). 

Relevance can often be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) according to the [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) *probability* that an element which is [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of context* will be [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in specific *[instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md)* of that type.
