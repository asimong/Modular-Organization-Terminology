*To record* is to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* which *[directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) [forces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md)* which are *sensed* at a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md)*.
		
The recording of *physical forces* is often [automated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) by physical [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).  Automated recordings avoid contamination by the *creative biases* of *[persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*.

Two [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) are [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) to create a recording:
* An [analog](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/analog.md) or [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) *[measuring](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) tool* must create [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) which represents [dimensionally variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/dimensional-variable.md) forces.
* The representative media must be stored.
