*To operate* is to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) an [instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md)* of a *[specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)*.

Note: this is often synonymous with [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md). However, the term operate is often [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) more *strictly* (and less *[adaptably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md)*), especially in [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*An operation* is a *specified (type or instance) action*.  [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) actions by *[identifying](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) the performance of operations*.
