A set is a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *group* of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which share at least one [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) could [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) a *limit*less number of sets, so it's important to focus *attention* on contextually [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) sets.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), agents often focus on sets which *name* or [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) *important* [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and systemic [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
