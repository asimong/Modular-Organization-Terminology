A set is a *collection* of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which share at least one directly [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identified.md) [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) could identify an endless variety of sets, so it's important to focus *attention* on [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) sets.  Agents often focus on sets which *name* or [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and systemic [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
