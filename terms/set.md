A set is a group of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which share at least one directly [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identified.md) [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

An endless variety of sets could be identified, so it's important to focus on identifying [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) sets.  [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often focus on [describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) sets which *name* or [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
