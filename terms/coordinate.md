Coordination is the [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of shared [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) (or [interactivity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)) which *modifies* or *arranges* separate activities to support one or more mutually shared [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).  
 
Note: mutually shared goals may, importantly, include the reduction or elimination of identifiable harm(s).  (For instance, the actions of two or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may be intentionally *differentiated* to reduce *conflict* or unnecessary *competition*.)
 
Coordination often occurs informally.  However, *group agents* may assign coordination responsibilities to individuals or to subgroup agents.  Note: a coordination [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) (or any *other* function) which is assigned to a subgroup becomes [collaborative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) work within the subgroup.
