A premise is a *[relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) which is [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) accepted within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)*.

Premises may or may not [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) the [beliefs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/belief.md) of any specific [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  

Note: *assumption* is often [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) as a synonym for premise.  However, assumption more often seems to imply belief.
