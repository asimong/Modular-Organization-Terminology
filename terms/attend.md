*To attend* is *to [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md)* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* during a specific [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md).
		
This intentionally [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [definition](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) is [valid](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) for many [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md), such as *listening to a speaker* or *reading a [text](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md)*.
		
**Other [Forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md):**  *Attention* is the *[personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* of *attending*.   Attention requires the (inherently scarce) resource of *personal time*. 
		
**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [Meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md):**  *To attend* often especially means  *to attend to* and to *[participate] in* a specific activity.  Such participatory *attending* often [requires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [physical] travel.  However, that need to travel is sometimes eliminated now by *telecommunications*.
