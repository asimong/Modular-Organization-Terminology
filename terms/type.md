A type is a general [specification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which may *vary* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Types contrast with [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of elements.

Types may be developed *complexly* at different *levels* of organization.  For instance, a type on one level may be a *subordinate* type or *subtype* in a broader organizational context.
