A type is a generic specification for a *potential* [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within an identified [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or context.  

Types contrast with *actual* instances of elements.

Types may be perceived at recursive levels of complex organization.  For instance, a type on one level may be a subtype on a broader level of organization.
