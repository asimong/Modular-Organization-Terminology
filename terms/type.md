A type is a generic [specification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md)* [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within an identifiable context or [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).  

Types contrast with [actual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/actual.md) instances of elements.

Types may be perceived at recursive levels of complex organization.  For instance, a type on one level may be a *subordinate* type or *subtype* in a broader organizational context.
