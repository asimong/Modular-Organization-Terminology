A directory is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [directions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md)* for *[transporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)*.

**Notes:**  

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) directories by [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) and [linking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) multiple *[storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md)* upon a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [device](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md)* or *server*.  However, it's [possible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) to [distribute](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) the *hosting* and *syncing* of *[community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [item](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md)* across many devices and servers which are [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) by different agents.  
		
Directories often link *media items* which have *[unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [addressable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/address.md) [identities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md)*.  However, [organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) by unique identities can be supplemented, or even replaced, by the development of *[composite](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/composite.md) [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md)*.
