Responsibility is the [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of  [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and other [organizational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), such as [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or other agents.

Agents have many [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) responsibilities.  They also often have many [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) responsibilities.

*Responsibilities* often relate socially to [investments](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/investment.md) as *[requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md)* and *[recommendations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md)* relate to *[actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)*.
