Responsibility is a [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and one or more [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).

Agents have many [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) responsibilities.  They also often have many [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) responsibilities.

*Responsibilities* are to *goals* as *[requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md)* and *[recommendations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md)* are to *[actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)*.
