Investment is the *commitment* of one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to support [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md), [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) or [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/actions.md) which can't be easily *reversed* or *transformed* without significant *losses*.
 
Note:  Decisions are always acts of investment.   However, the term investment is often  restricted to decisions about investments of resources which are valued, and *scarce*, within a clearly identifiable [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
