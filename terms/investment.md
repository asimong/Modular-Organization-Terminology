Investment is the [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of [authorizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) the *use* of a *scarce* [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to support [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md), [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) or [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/actions.md) which can't be easily *reversed* or *transformed* without significant *losses*.
 
Note:  [Decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md) always create investments.   However, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often limit the [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of the term "investment" to clearly [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
