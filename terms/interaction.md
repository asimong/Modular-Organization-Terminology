An interaction is a [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) of [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md), [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) which seem to be clearly *co-causal*, due to their *mutual dependence* within a reasonably *isolated* and/or *insulated* [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
 
Contexts for conceptual interactions vary greatly.  By contrast, identifiable *physical* contexts tend to be extremely limited in their spatial and/or temporal *scale*.  However, this depends greatly on the scale and level of detail of the potentially inter-acting [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) being considered.  
 
For instance, we may confidently state that a cat ate a bowl of food which it came into contact with for a few minutes.  The cat and the food are interacting elements within a relatively compact frame of reference by human standards, although that scale would be ineffably immense to a dust mite.  Likewise, scientists may determine that a specific black hole is consuming a specific star.  The  black hole and the star are interacting elements, but their interaction occurs within an immensely larger frame of reference than the cat and the food, because these interacting elements contain intense forces which act continuously and predictably over great distances.   Such large-scale intensity and predictability is not the case with most interacting elements at typical scales of human experience.  
 
Most interactions are extremely localized in both space and time *because of* the limited range of interacting forces, which insulates the interactive elements in question from most other elements which are [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) highly interactive within the frame of reference being considered.  However, our predictions or simulations of most (uncontrolled) interactions over long periods of time (a larger frame of reference) rapidly break down via the exponentially expanding complexity of our interactions over time, as described in chaos theory.   (Also, localization does not imply complete separation or isolation.)
