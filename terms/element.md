An element is a [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of substance, percept or concept which can be identified as a distinct part of a conceptual or physical [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md), [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  This term relates closely to matter-energy, substance, [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) and [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).     

Each element can be identified as a unit, set or field of matter-energy, perception or conception which has a collectively unique set of [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) within an identifiable context.

The identifiable properties of elements may only function within identifiable parameters, such a range of perception for a contextually relevant observer or sensor.  

Complex processes, [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and organisms often act (or are perceived) as elements within larger contexts.  For example, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) often interact as elements within [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

In [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md), design *arts* and [engineering](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/engineering.md), elements often function as [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).  For example, a *digital* [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) is a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) elements which functions as a ([component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md)) element in a [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) system.
