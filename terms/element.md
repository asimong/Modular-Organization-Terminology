An element is an *[instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) or [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type)* of *[substance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substance.md), [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) or [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md)* which can be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as a *[component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) or [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.  Â  

Each instance *and* each type of element can be identified as a *unit*, [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) or *field* of matter-energy, concept or experience which has a collectively [unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) *set of [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

The properties of elements may only [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) within specific [parameters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md), such a *range of perception* for an active [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or *sensor*.

[Complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and *organisms* often [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) (or are perceived) as elements within larger contexts.  For example, agents and [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) often [interact](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) as elements within [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

In [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md), design *arts* and [engineering](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/engineering.md), elements often function as [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).  For example, a *digital* [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) is a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) elements which functions as a ([component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md)) element in a [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) system.
