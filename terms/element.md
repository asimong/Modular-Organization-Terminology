An element is a [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of substance, percept or concept which can be identified as a distinct part of a mental or physical [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or context.  This term relates closely to matter-energy, substance, function and to holon.     

Each element can be identified as a unit, set or field of matter-energy, perception or conception which has a collectively unique set of [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) within an identifiable [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

The identifiable properties of elements may only function within identifiable parameters, such a range of perception for a contextually relevant observer or sensor.  

Complex processes, [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) and organisms often act (or are perceived) as elements within larger contexts.  For example, agents and resources often interact as elements within designed systems.

In [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md), design arts and engineering, elements often function as [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md).  For example, a digital signal is a set of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) elements which functions as a (component) element in a communications system.
