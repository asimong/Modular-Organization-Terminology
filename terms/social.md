"Social" is a [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which contain *[interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) and/or [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*. Â 

The broad domain of social interactions and relationships includes many elements which can be described as [cultural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/culture.md), [economy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economic.md) and/or [political](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/politics.md).
 
Social elements contrast with [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) elements.
