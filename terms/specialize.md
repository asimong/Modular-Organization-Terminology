To specialize is to *[adapt](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md)* a *[potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)* to a *more strict and [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md)*.

Specialized actions are often more [detailed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/detail.md).

**Synonyms:**  

* The term *customize* is [analogous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/analog.md) to *the specialization of [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).*
* *precise* is often [functionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) equivalent to *specialized*
