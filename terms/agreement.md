An agreement is a [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) which is mutually *accepted* by two or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) within an identifiable [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Agreements often describe [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).  However, the description of plans is a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of agreement.

Agreements may or may not be [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md).  Official agreements must be not only mutually accepted, but mutually *confirmed* (usually via *signature*).  
 
Agreements may develop through any combination of *asynchronous* and *synchronous* [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).  Official agreements must be expressed in *indicative* (and usually *declarative*) sentences in a mutually understood *language*.
