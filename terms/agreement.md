An agreement is an [indication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) which is *[mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [approved](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md)* by two or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

**Notes:**

*Agreement* is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).

Agreements often describe [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).  However, the description of plans is just one [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of agreement*.

Agreements may or may not be [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md).  Official agreements must be not only mutually approved, but mutually *confirmed* (usually via [signature](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signature.md)).  Official agreements must be expressed in *indicative* (and usually *declarative*) sentences in a mutually understood [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).
 
[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) agreements through [proposals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/proposal.md).  Proposals and agreements may be developed through any combination of [serial processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/serial-process.md) and [parallel processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parallel-process.md).
