Accuracy is a [dimensional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) how closely an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) *corresponds* to its [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) *becomes more accurate* if it provides *more [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* and is *equally or more* true.   Likewise, [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) become more accurate if they come closer to achieving their intended [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)(s).
