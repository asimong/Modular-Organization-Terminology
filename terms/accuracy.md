Accuracy is a *[dimensional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) *how closely an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) corresponds to its [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) is *more accurate* if (1) it provides *more [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md)* and (2) is *equally or more [true](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/true.md)*.   Likewise, [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) become more accurate if they come closer to realizing their intended [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)(s).
