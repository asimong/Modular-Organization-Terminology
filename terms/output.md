An output is an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which exits from a specific process or [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

Outputs often exit from subordinate systems to be used as inputs in the primary system.
