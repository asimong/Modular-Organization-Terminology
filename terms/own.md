*To own* is the *[potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [exclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) [right](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) in a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Like all forms of exclusion, the [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of *ownership* is closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to [restriction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md).
		
*Note:*  Ownership is a traditional concept.  It's highly [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to current [legal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/legal.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md); however, it's not [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) favored in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/), which enables [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) and [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) more flexible [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), restrictions and [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) regarding [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to specific resources.
