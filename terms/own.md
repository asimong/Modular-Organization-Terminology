Like all forms of exclusion, *ownership* is closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to *[restriction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md)*.
		
**Notes:**  Ownership is a traditional [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md).  It's highly [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to current [legal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/law.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md); however, it's not [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) favored in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/), which enables [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) and [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) more flexible [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), restrictions and [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) regarding [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to specific resources.
