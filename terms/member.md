A member is an *[instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) in a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.

**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [Meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md):** [Group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) are defined by the *[roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) of [participating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*, and those roles often include a [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) and [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) "membership" role for [personal agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/personal-agent.md).   Thus, the term "member" often implies "[personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) member" in [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  Such members are often [peers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[decision-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md)making [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*.
