A member is an [instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) in a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md).

Note: [group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) are defined by the *membership* of [personal agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/personal-agent.md).   Thus, the term "member" often implies *[personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) member* in [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
