*Time* is the *[dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of [changing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md)*.

**Specialized Meaning:**  The [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *time*, and [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) including it, are often used as *[relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md)* which [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) the *[position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) in local time* that [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) occurred, or are [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) for.  (For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) may state that they walked to the park at the time of 4:30 pm, or a [computer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/computer.md) may [record](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md) that a file's *time [received](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md)* was 8:28 am on 5 Feb 2017.)

**Notes:** Each [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) time *and* [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) *subjectively*, often *according* to a [series](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/series.md) of [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) which practically *disregards the space between [interacting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  Thus, the term "time" is much more commonly [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) than the more [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and [accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accurate.md) term *[spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md)*.
