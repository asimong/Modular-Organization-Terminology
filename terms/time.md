Time is the [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of [changing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).

Each [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) time *and* [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) *subjectively*, often *according* to a [series](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/series.md) of [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) which practically *disregards the space between [interacting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  Thus, the term "time" is much more commonly [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) than the more [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) and [accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accurate.md) term "[spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md)".
