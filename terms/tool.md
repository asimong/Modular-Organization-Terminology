A tool is a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which predictably *provides* one or more [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) without being *consumed* or *transformed*.

[Physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) tools are subject to *deterioration*.
