Training is [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/activity.md) which *[develops](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/develop.md) one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/specific.md) [skills](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/skill.md)*.

Skills can often be developed by directly [using](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/use.md) them, especially if such use includes *[relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/relevance.md) [variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/variable.md)* which [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/facilitation.md) the development of [adaptability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/adapt.md) and *improved [conception](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/concept.md)* of those skills.  However, training often develops skills according to [programs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/program.md) which use them in very specific, *repetitive* and (sometimes) *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/intention.md) varied* ways.  Such programs are especially associated with (much) training which is [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/governance.md) or facilitated by *other agents* including teachers and coaches.  (However, agents also often use self-governed programs.)
