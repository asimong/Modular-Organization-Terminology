A form is an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *[emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) from* *[relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* between *other* elements.   

This basic term can be applied to the vast majority of *perceived* elements.  Depending on [communicative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) and [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md) of [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md), a specific [instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) or [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) may be described as an element *or* a form.

*Note: "Structure" is a closely related term.  However, "a structure" is most accurately described as a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).*

Forms may *include* one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of elements.  Forms which contain groups may or may *not* be [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) as the *sum* or *product* of those specific groups.

A form is reasonably stable (per specific [parameters](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md)) within one or more specific contexts, but those contexts may be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [physically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) or [conceptually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), physical contexts have both *temporal* and *spatial* [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md), within which forms can be identified by potential observer [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and/or *sensing* [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).  

Physical forms may be perceived as *particles*, *waves* or *fields* at different scales of organization.  Particles, waves and fields may all be perceived as *fluid* or *solid* at different scales of organization.  Conceptual forms often may have analogies to the discrete bonds of particles and the inflexible bonds of solids.  (etc)

Fluid forms often last briefly.  For example, an identifiably shaped gust (four dimensional waveform) of wind may last a few seconds.  However, fluid forms also may persist indefinitely if sustained by persistent inputs of energy.  For example, a stretch of rapids on a river, or an oceanic whirlpool, may last for decades or centuries.  

Solid forms may also last briefly.  For example, a snowflake may melt a few seconds after landing on a warm surface.  However, solid forms may last long periods in the absence of intensely or persistently creative/destructive energy.  For example, a mountain may endure (while slowly eroding) for millions of years.   

*Note*:  **Forms often [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as elements** in larger models (or overviews) with lower levels of detail.  For instance, snowflakes and mountains often function as conceptual elements, despite being clearly identifiable as (complex) forms.
