A form is an arrangement or configuration of one or more elements.

Forms are often simple, compound or complex.

Forms are always reasonably stable (per identifiable parameters) within identifiable contexts.  For instance, physical contexts have both temporal and spatial scale, within which forms can be identified by contextually relevant observers and/or sensors.  

Forms may be fluid or solid.  

Fluid forms often last briefly.  For example, an identifiably shaped gust (four dimensional waveform) of wind may last a few seconds.  However, fluid forms also may persist indefinitely if sustained by persistent inputs of energy.  For example, a stretch of rapids on a river, or an oceanic whirlpool, may last for decades or centuries.  

Solid forms may also last briefly.  For example, a snowflake may melt a few seconds after landing on a warm surface.  However, solid forms may last long periods in the absence of intensely or persistently creative/destructive energy.  For example, a mountain may endure (while slowly eroding) for millions of years.   

*Note*:  **Forms often function as elements** in models (or overviews) with lower levels of detail.  For instance, snowflakes and mountains often function as conceptual elements, despite being clearly identifiable as (complex) forms.
