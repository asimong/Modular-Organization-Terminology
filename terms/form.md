A form is a clearly identifiable *set* or [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of one or more [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

--*Note: "Structure" is a closely related term.  However, a structure is most accurately described as a (common) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of form.  "Structure" will receive its own entry.*-- 

Forms are often *simple*, *compound* or *complex*.

Forms are always reasonably stable (per identifiable parameters) within identifiable contexts.  For instance, physical contexts have both temporal and spatial scale, within which forms can be identified by potential observers and/or sensors.  

Forms may be fluid or solid.  

Fluid forms often last briefly.  For example, an identifiably shaped gust (four dimensional waveform) of wind may last a few seconds.  However, fluid forms also may persist indefinitely if sustained by persistent inputs of energy.  For example, a stretch of rapids on a river, or an oceanic whirlpool, may last for decades or centuries.  

Solid forms may also last briefly.  For example, a snowflake may melt a few seconds after landing on a warm surface.  However, solid forms may last long periods in the absence of intensely or persistently creative/destructive energy.  For example, a mountain may endure (while slowly eroding) for millions of years.   

*Note*:  **Forms often function as elements** in larger models (or overviews) with lower levels of detail.  For instance, snowflakes and mountains often function as conceptual elements, despite being clearly identifiable as (complex) forms.
