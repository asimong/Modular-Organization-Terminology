Technology is an expansive term which describes tools, techniques, and systems of tools and techniques.  

Technology enables agents to perform intentional processes, including functions which create or enhance fitness within the context of desired goals.

People may refer to a group of tools and techniques as “*a* technology”.  This can usefully indicate groups of tools and techniques which are informally related through cultural development, and not all present (nor compatible) within any specific systems of producing activity or resources.
