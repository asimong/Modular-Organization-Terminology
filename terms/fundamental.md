Fundamental is a [relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md) indicating that an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) provides a *[required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* at a *[simpler](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) [level](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level.md)* of a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.

**Notes:** [Describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) an element as fundamental to a form does *not* necessarily imply any assessment of the "overall" [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) of the [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) elements.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md), a regular monetary income may be fundamental to Jane's health within a specific formal [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md); however, [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) and [sustaining](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) that income may seem anywhere from quite simple to incomprehensively complex in varying cases.

**Synonyms:** *basic*
