An agent is an *[identity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md) which has [agency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agency.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

Agents often directly [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) in [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  In fact, we rarely distinguish *self-representative* agents from actual persons, especially in *live* *in-person* [interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md).   However, each person may have multiple identities with separate [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) in some social contexts. Also (and quite [significantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/significance.md)), *[group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)* [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in many social contexts.

Note: Each specific agent's identity should be *unique* within each [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) context.
