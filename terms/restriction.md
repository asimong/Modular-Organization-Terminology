Restriction is a [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)-- [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) including *[planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)*-- and an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) who *[intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [governs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of that resource* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Restrictions are often *[coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercion.md) [protective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protect.md) [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md)* to *prevent actions or [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* which an agent either (1) directly *prohibits* or (2) has *not* directly [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md). 

The concept of *restriction* is closely related to the concept of [ownership](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/own.md).
