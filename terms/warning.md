A warning is a [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) which either *directly* or *indirectly* [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) a [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) and one or more  [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *harmful* actions.
 
Warnings are often but not inevitably [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercive.md).  Their [intentions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) can be purely *helpful* and [informative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md).  For example: *if* an agent performs Action A, *then* Action B will probably occur-- regardless of whether or not the warning person performs Action B, or in fact has any [agency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agency.md) which seems [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to the [probability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/probability.md) of Action B.
 
Warnings often describe a potential *protective* action, in which one or more agents will try to stop identifiable harm from occurring to one or more agents.  Such protective action may often [restrict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) the *current* or *imminently probable* actions of others without otherwise harming them.  However, protective use of force may also sometimes create *predictable* and unavoidable *risks* of creating unintentional lasting harm to subjects of restrictive force.
