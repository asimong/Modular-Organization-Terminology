Coercion is [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which [warns](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/warning.md) (or [threatens](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/threat.md)) with [restrictive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) [intentions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md). 
 
There are two general [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of coercion which can occur separately or together: *institutional coercion* and *interpersonal coercion*. 

Institutional coercion includes cases when people are coerced by any group rules which call for automatic [punishment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/punishment.md).  Institutional coercion differs from *groupthink*, including moblike behavior.

Institutional coercion may cause interpersonal coercion through abused authority.  In other cases, however, it may seem impersonal even if it’s ‘executed’ by a specific person or persons. 

Interpersonal coercion, by contrast, results from *non-institutional* warnings or threats.

Persistent interpersonal coercion (i.e., dominance or oppression) can sometimes *derive from* institutional coercion *if* individuals have personal coercive [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) via *officially* *assigned* [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md).  Such concentrated power often has a corrupting influence.
