Coercion is *direct* or *indirect* [warning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/warning.md) or *threat* of [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) *harm* with the [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) of *influencing* the [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  
 
There are two general [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of coercion which can occur separately or together: *interpersonal coercion* and *institutional coercion*.  
 
Interpersonal coercion may result from personal warnings, threats or from the direct application of harmful force.  
 
Persistent interpersonal coercion (i.e., dominance or oppression) may *derive from* institutional coercion *if* individuals have personal coercive [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) via *officially* *assigned* [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md).  Such concentrated power often has a corrupting influence.
 
Institutional coercion, as noted above, may cause episodes of interpersonal coercion through abused authority.  In other cases, however, it may seem impersonal even if it’s ‘executed’ by a specific person or persons.  

Institutional coercion includes cases when people are coerced by any group rules which call for automatic [punishment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/punishment.md).  Institutional coercion differs from *groupthink*, including moblike behavior.
