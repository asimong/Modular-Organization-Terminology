Roles indicate socially-defined [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) which [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can have with other agents or [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), including [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) and *group agents*.  Roles create one or more recognized responsibilities and [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md).  
 
Roles often create [relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) or [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).  Complex, persistent systemic roles are often referred to as *positions, posts* or *occupations*.]
