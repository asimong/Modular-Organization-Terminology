A decision is an [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of [committing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/commitment.md) the *use* of one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md), [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) or action.  See also [budgeting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/budgeting.md) and [investment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/investment.md).

While [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often seem to unconsciously [react](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/reaction.md) to *stimuli*, we also often make conscious decisions which commit resources to specific actions in the near future.  We also frequently decide to commit resources to [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md) or plans in the short, medium or long-term future.   Plans vary widely in their *openness* and *adaptability* to ongoing stimuli.
