A decision is the [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of *committing* the use of one or more [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to an identified [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md), [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) or action.  See also [budgeting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/budgeting.md) and [investment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/investment.md).

While many actions seem to be automatically selected by [agents'](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) unconscious *reactions* to *stimuli*, we frequently make conscious decisions which commit us to specific actions in the immediate or imminent future.  We also frequently make decisions to commit ourselves to principles, practices or plans of action in the short, medium to long-term future.   Plans vary widely in their receptivity and adaptability to ongoing energy flows.
