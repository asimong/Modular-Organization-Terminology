A process is a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/network.md) of [interactive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/element.md) with one or more directly identified [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md), [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) *and* [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).  
 
Identified processes often act as [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which are [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  Functional processes are often [engineered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/engineering.md) according to a [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) of identifying *all* inputs, activities and outputs which seem important within an identifiable [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Identified processes may occur [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) or [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md).
