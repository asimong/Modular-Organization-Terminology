A process is a *[network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/network.md) of [interactive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/element.md)* with *one or more directly [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md), [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md)*.  
 
Processes [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of inputs* to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) specific [interactions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).  Processes may also *[officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [permit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/permission.md)* or even *[recommend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md)* other non-required inputs.
 
Identified processes often act as [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which are [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  Functional processes are often [engineered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/engineering.md) to identify *all* inputs, activities and outputs which seem *important* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

An identified processes may occur [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *or* [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) within a specific context.
