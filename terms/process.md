A process is an [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) with identifiable [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md), [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).  
 
Identified processes may occur [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) or [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md). 
 
Identified processes often [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  Functional processes are often [engineered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/engineering.md) with the [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) of identifying all inputs, activities and outputs which seem important within an identifiable [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
