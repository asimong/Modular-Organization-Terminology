A system is a potentially occurring, recurring or continuous [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) created by one or more identified inputs, functions *and* [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).

Some systems may be identified mainly by a network of physical [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  For instance, a toaster is a system which has been created by networking physical [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which match identifiable [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for systemic function(s).

Systems may be physical, conceptual or social, and may emerge naturally or be intentionally planned.
