A system is a [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *occurring, recurring or continuous* [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).  

Many or most systems include *complexly* [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) processes.

Some systems may be identified mainly by a network of physical [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  For instance, a toaster is a system which has been created by networking physical [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which match identifiable [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for systemic [function(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).

Systems are generally determined by feedback loops, reinforcement, and often amplification (but sometimes degeneration, implosion or explosion) of inputs.   *Robust* systems have strong positive feedback.  *Resilient* systems have strong positive feedback in some ways, are less defined in others, and are strongly receptive to external forces.

Systems may be physical, conceptual or social, and may emerge naturally or be intentionally planned.
