A system is any persistent pattern of activity sustained by recurrent inputs into one or more identifiable processes.

Some systems may be identified mainly or entirely by a combination of physical elements.  For instance, a toaster is a system which has been created by combining physical components which match the requirements for systemic function.

Systems may be physical, conceptual or social, and may emerge naturally or be intentionally planned.
