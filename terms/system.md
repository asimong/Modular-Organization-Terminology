A system is a potentially occurring, recurring or continuous [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) created by one or more identified inputs, functions *and* [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md).

Many or most systems complexly relate interdependent processes.

Some systems may be identified mainly by a network of physical [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  For instance, a toaster is a system which has been created by networking physical [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which match identifiable [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for systemic function(s).

Systems are generally determined by feedback loops, reinforcement, and often amplification (but sometimes degeneration, implosion or explosion) of inputs.   *Robust* systems have strong positive feedback.  *Resilient* systems have strong positive feedback in some ways, are less defined in others, and are strongly receptive to external forces.

Systems may be physical, conceptual or social, and may emerge naturally or be intentionally planned.
