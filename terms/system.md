A system is a *[potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) recurring or continuous* [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).  

Many or most systems are [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) *[networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of processes*.

Some systems may be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) mainly by a network of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  For instance, a toaster is a system which has been created by networking physical [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which match [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) for systemic [function(s)](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).

Systems are generally determined by [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) of [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) and [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) which create *positive* or *negative feedback*.  For instance, feedback can *amplify* or *attenuate* inputs.   *Robust* systems have well-defined positive and negative feedback systems which create *sustainability* and *security* against potential [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md).  *Resilient* systems are robust *and* are *complexly adaptive* to diverse inputs.

Systems may be *physical, [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) or [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md)*, and may [emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) or be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).
