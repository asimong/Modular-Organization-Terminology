*To receive* is [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) which *adds* *portable* [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to a [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) or [composite](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/composite.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

Receiving is often associated with the reception of non-*scarce* [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md), and it's also often associated with the reception of resources which are scarce and/or [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md).  For instance, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often receive [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) to restricted resources.
