Authority is the *broadly and powerfully* recognized [right](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) to *author*, *enforce* or *abjudicate* *indicative* (and usually *declarative*) statements within an identifiable social [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  This includes *political* and *legal* statements.
 
Authority is always artificial, and is rarely recognized by all people who are influenced (and often coerced) by authoritative actions.
