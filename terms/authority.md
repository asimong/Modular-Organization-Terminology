Authority is the [right](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) to *use*, *author*, [edit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edit.md), *enforce* or *abjudicate* [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) tend to [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) authority as a [simple](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) yes/no *binary*.  However, unofficial authority is often in[form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)ally perceived as a subtly [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md).
 
Official authority is always [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md), and is rarely recognized by all people whose [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) are [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [regulated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulation.md), [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) or otherwise [coerced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercion.md) by authoritative actions.
