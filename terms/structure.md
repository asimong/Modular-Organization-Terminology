*Structure* is a synonym for [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) Meaning:**  Structure often especially means *the [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.

Within that [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), "a structure" is a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) network of physical elements*.   

Structure also often implies *[designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) structure* in some [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). However, it's also used broadly to indicate [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) structures.
