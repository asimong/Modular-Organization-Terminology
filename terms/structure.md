Structure is the *[networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.

"A structure" is a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) network of physical elements*.   

Note: Structure implies *[designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) structure* in some specific [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). However, it's also used broadly to indicate [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) structures.
