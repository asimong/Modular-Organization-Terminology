Change is identified difference in [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) and/or [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in two or more [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). 

Change is quite often perceived and described according to *change over time*:  difference(s) between past, present and/or future contexts.

Change can often be perceived through *gradual*, indefinitely occurring change over time.  However, change may sometimes be perceived as a *sudden* shift between *discretely identified* states within existing forms and elements. Change may also be perceived as the creative *emergence* or *destruction* of forms or elements.

*A change* is a discretely identified difference between two contexts.  Gradually occurring change may be discretely identified by indicating qualitative parameters.  (For instance, many physical and chemical reactions will asymptotically approach a state which is practically identical to dynamic equilibrium.)
