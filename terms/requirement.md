A requirement is a [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) which must be [actively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) present in an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)-- potentially including [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)-- in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [authoritative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

Requirements for [participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participant.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) are often [created](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) in a [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which is *mutually dependent* with the creation of [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md).
