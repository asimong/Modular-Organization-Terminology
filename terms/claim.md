For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often claim *to have [performed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) specific actions*, or *to have [experienced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) specific [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md)*.
