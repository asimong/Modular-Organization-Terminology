To define is to [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in ways which *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md)* for the *[potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* of that element.

Definitions often attempt to [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) the [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) traits of an element, thus making [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of that element distinct and clear.

See also [specification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md).  

The act of definition may *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md)* [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) elements, and is [generally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) quite useful for designed elements.  However, *specification* is more [formally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) strict *and* more flexible than *definition*, especially for [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) elements.  Thus, **specification is a generally preferred term in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/)**.
