A context is a group, network or [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) within which a specific [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) is meant to be considered.
 
Contexts can be verbally described.  Formal design and modeling contexts may be explicitly [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md).
 
Contexts are used to orient attention, perception and [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md).
