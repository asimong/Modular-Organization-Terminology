*To localize* is to *reduce the [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md)* of a [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

"Localized" is a [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *have had* their scope reduced, regardless of whether that reduction reflects *design [priorities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/priority.md)* or *[emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) [adaptation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md)*.

Localization often reduces [spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) scope, but may also reduce a *field* of *[potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) and [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md)* according to [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) relationships, including [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) based on the *digitally* *distributed* [creation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) or [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) of [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).
