*To localize* is to [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) reduce the [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) of a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  

"Localized" is a *property* of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) with reduced scope, regardless of whether that has occurred through design or *naturally*.

Localization often reduces *geographic* scope, but may also reduce a *field* of potential [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) and [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) according to [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) relationships, including [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) based on the *digitally* *distributed* [creation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) or *governance* of [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).
