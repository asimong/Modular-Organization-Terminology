Representation is the [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) of *[reporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md)* or *[designing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md)* [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) with [signs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sign.md), including [symbols](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/symbol.md), which *re-present* other [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).

Representation often *translates* elements into [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fundamental.md) different [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), we often represent [experiential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) elements as [ideas](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/idea.md) which we [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) as [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)-- and, our concepts often represent [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md) *and* [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) experiences.
