*To persist* is *to last* (or to remain stable) *without any specific [temporal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md) [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md)* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes:** The context within which an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) persists *may have many specific limits*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an ocean may persist indefinitely on a specific planet, but it would not survive the planet's [destruction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md).

**Important Synonym:** *endure*

**[Related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [Terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md):** 

* *permanence*:  *Permanent* is often practically synonymous with *persistent*, but has also been [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for (non-logical) [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) about [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) supposedly lasting forever, or existing outside of the *[spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) continuum*.    

*Persistent* is more *[precise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) and [generally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)* than *permanent*, so it's a preferred term in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).

* *indelible*:  *Indelible* [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that a specific element *can't be [eliminated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/eliminate.md)* with any of the known [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tools.md) within a specific context.  Note:  *Indelible* may also imply that any forced elimination of such an element would [destroy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md) its containing [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).
