*To persist* is *to last* (or *to remain stable*) either (1) during a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md) or (2) without any specific [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) within a specific [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**Notes:** *Permanent* and *indelible* are [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md).  *Permanent* is often practically synonymous with *persistent*, but has also been [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for (non-logical) [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) about [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) supposedly lasting forever, or existing outside of the *[spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) continuum*.    

*Persistent* is a relatively *[precise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) and [generally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)* term, and I generally [recommend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md) using it with [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).
		
**Synonyms:** *endure*
