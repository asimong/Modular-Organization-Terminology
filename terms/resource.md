A resource is a *source* of matter, energy or [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) which is [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) by the [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  

This [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) broad [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) includes all [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) resources.  

[Specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) resources are often intentionally [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) by [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).  This may develop by default/arbitrarily, depending on the history of each resource, but it's often artificially and intentionally done to [restrict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) access to identifiable [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or for identifiable activities.
