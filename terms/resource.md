A resource is a *source* of matter, energy or [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) which is [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) by the [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) or [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of one or more [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  

This [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) includes all [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) resources.  

Agents often [perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md), [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) and [discuss](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) and [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md)* of resource.  

[Specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) resources are often [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) by [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).  Such relationships may [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) *or* unintentionally *[restrict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)* to related resources.
