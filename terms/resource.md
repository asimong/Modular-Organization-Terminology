A resource is an identifiable, often complex [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which provides a source of matter, energy and/or information which one or more persons want or need to use, or to re-source, in their activities.  This intentionally broad definition includes all physical, personal, social and information resources.  

Distinctly identifiable resources are often loosely or tightly bundled (compounded).  This may develop by default/arbitrarily, depending on the history of each resource, but it's often artificially and intentionally done to create exclusive access for identifiable [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) and/or activities.


A **physical resource** is a stable [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) of matter or energy which is usable within an identified context.

*Note:  I plan to add descriptions of other types of resources here.*
