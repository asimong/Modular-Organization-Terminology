Collaboration is the [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of cooperative [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) (or [interactivity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) which is oriented towards creating a shared, unitary or singular result.  

Collaboration can be defined by shared [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and/or [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).

The [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) result(s) of collaboration may complexly contain separately useful [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) and [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  However, collaborators perceive value in a unified pursuit of those result(s).
 
Collaboration often occurs informally.  However, *group [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* can *assign* *subordinate* collaborative work to related agents or groups.
