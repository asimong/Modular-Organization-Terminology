Collaboration is the *cooperative [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* (or [interactivity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)) with a *mutually [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md)* [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) of [creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) a *shared* or *merged* result.  

Collaboration can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) by identifying shared goals or shared [plans](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md).

The [intended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) goal(s) of collaboration may [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md) contain separately *useful* [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  However, collaborators perceive value in a unified pursuit of those result(s).
 
Collaboration often occurs in[form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)ally and un[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md)ly.  However, *[group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)* may officially [assign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) *subordinate* work to [subgroups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subgroup.md).
