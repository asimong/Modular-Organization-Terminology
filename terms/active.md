An active [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) or [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) is a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) form or element which is identifiably acting within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

*Note:*  I plan to add one or more examples to illustrate the IMO frequently useful distinction between *actual* and *potential*.
