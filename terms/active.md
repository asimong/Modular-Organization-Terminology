An active (or actual) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) is a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) element which has been [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Active elements may or may not *create [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)* within any specific [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) within the context.

*Note:*  I plan to add one or more examples to illustrate the IMO frequently useful distinction between *active* and *potential*.
