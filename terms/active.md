An active [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) is a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) element which is identifiably *present* within an [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md). 

Active elements may or may not *create [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)* within an identifiable period of time.

*Note:*  I plan to add one or more examples to illustrate the IMO frequently useful distinction between *active* and *potential*.
