A federation is a *group [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* formed *by* group agents.
 
While the [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) above is quite [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) simple, the term “federation” has been applied to a wide variety of *complex* groups with diverse [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md). 
 
Strictly speaking, a federation is developed through the [emergence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) of a [coordinating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordination.md) group agent which *manages* [restrictive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) as *requirements* for *membership* in the federation.  

In some cases, the coordinating agent may require that member group agents-- and *their* members-- are *subordinate* to the coordinating agent in one or more *specific* [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), *responsibilities* and/or [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).  In other cases, member group agents and/or member *individual* agents may be considered mostly or completely [autonomous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md).
