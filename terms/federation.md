**Definition:** A federation is a *[group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)* which *contains group agents*.
 
**Notes:**  The definition above is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md).  “Federation” has been applied to many [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) groups with [varying](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md). 
 
[Strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) speaking, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a federation by *[developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) a [coordinating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) group agent*, which [governs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) which [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) group agents to *become [member agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/member-agent.md)* in the federation.  

In some cases, a federation's coordinating agent may specify that member group agents-- and *their* members-- are strictly *[subforms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subform.md)* of the coordinating agent, or *are subordinate* to the coordinating agent in one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) and/or [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).  In other cases, however, member group agents and/or member [personal agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/personal-agent.md) may be considered mostly or completely [autonomous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md).
