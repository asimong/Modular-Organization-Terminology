To prescribe is to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercion.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

Note: *Prescribe* is *less specific* than *rule*.  Both terms [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to social contexts; however, prescriptions don't necessarily create coercive expectation *in* any social context.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), one may prescribe specific rules for external [participation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participation.md) in the [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of a *[personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* without "ruling" (creating rules for) the development of a *social resource*.
