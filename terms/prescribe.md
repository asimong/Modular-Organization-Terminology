To prescribe is to *[restrict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

Note: *Prescription* is *less specific* than *[rule](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)*.  Both terms [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to social contexts; however, prescriptions don't necessarily restrict an existing social context.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), one may prescribe specific rules for external [participation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participation.md) in the [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of a *[personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) resource* without "ruling" (creating rules for) the development of any *social resources*.
