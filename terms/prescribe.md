To prescribe is to *[restrict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) the [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

Note: *Prescription* is *less specific* than *[rule](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)*.  Both terms [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to social contexts; however, prescriptions don't necessarily restrict the social context, and aren't necessarily [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercion.md).
