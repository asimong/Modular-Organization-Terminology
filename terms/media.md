Media is the [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of all *[representational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*.

Note: this [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) is, [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md), somewhat *more [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md)* than the plural of [medium](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/medium.md) would be within the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology).  However, this is an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) definition which can apply to the vast majority of [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) and information resources.

Media often represents *visual* and/or *acoustic* information.  Such visual and acoustic information diversely represents [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) and *nonlanguage* information.
