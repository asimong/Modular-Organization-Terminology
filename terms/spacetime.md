*Spacetime* is the *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md)* of [relative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md).

We often [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) spacetime mostly *according* to a [series](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/series.md) of [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) which practically *disregard* the space between *quickly [interacting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.  Thus, the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *time* is much more commonly [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) than the more *[socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md)* and *[accurate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accurate.md)* term *spacetime*.
