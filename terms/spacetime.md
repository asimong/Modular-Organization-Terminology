Spacetime is the [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) of [relative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md).

We often [experience](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) spacetime mostly *according* to a [series](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/series.md) of [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md) which practically *disregard* the space between [interacting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md).  Thus, the term "time" is much more commonly [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) than "spacetime".
