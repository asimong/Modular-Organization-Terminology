Recommendation is a [relational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) indicating that the *sender* of the [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) finds the *subject* element to be *desirable* within the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of the *predicate* element.

Recommendations contrast with [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md).

Recommendations may exist for perceived positive benefit *and/or* for *risk* *governance*.  

Recommendations of relationships between [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of elements are often named as **guidelines**.  By contrast, recommendations of relationships between [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific) [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of elements are often *named* as recommendations.   For example, recommendations of specific [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) for specific [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) can be an important part of group agent [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md).
