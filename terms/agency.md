Agency is a compound, emergent personal [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) with three constituent properties: the *ability, capacity and [opportunity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md) to make meaningful decisions between possible [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or non-action within a personal or social [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

Agency is normally associated with opportunities which do *not* significantly diminish oneâ€™s future agency within the described context.  For instance, sustainable systems often require persistent human [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md).

Agency is exclusively a property of (some, but not all) complexly adaptive systems-- including organisms, social groups and organizations-- because such systems have the ability to *sustain, regulate and repair* their decision-making agency within identifiable [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) which contain significantly varying conditions.
