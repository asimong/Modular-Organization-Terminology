Agency is a [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) which [emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) from three properties: the *ability, capacity and [opportunity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md)* to make meaningful [decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

Agency is normally associated with opportunities which do *not* *inevitably* [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) the [agent's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) *future* agency.  For instance, *sustainable* [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) the persistent [assignment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assignment.md) of (sustainably [acting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)) agents to [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) which *provide* systemic [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).

Agency is *exclusively* a property of (some, but not all) *complexly adaptive systems*-- including *organisms*, [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) and [group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)-- because such systems have the ability to *sustain, regulate and repair* their decision-making agency within contexts with *intensely* [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md).
