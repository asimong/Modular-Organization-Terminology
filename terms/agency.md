Agency is a *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* which [emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) from the *presence* of three other traits: the *[ability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md), [capacity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/capacity.md) and [opportunity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md)* to [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or to make *important* [decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

**Notes:**  

Agency is normally associated with actions and decisions which do *not* *inevitably* [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) the [agent's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) *future* agency.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), *[sustainable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)* often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) the ongoing [assignment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assignment.md) of (sustainably [acting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)) agents to [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) which [provide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) systemic [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).

Agency is a trait of (some, but not all) *[complex adaptive systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/complex-adaptive-system.md)*-- including [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) and *[group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md)*-- because such systems have the ability to *sustain, [regulate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) and [repair](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repair.md)* their decision-making agency within contexts with *intensely* [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) traits.

Agents may sometimes *[delegate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) their agency* in specific contexts not only to other complexly adaptive agents, but also to *bots* or to *automated [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* which they've [personally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) approved.
