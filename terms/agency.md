Agency is a compound, emergent personal [property](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md) with three constituent properties: the *ability*, *capacity* and [opportunity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md) to make meaningful [decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

Agency is normally associated with opportunities which do *not* significantly diminish oneâ€™s future agency within the described context.  For instance, sustainable [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) often require persistent [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) which serve specific [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).

Agency is exclusively a property of (some, but not all) complexly adaptive systems-- including organisms, social groups and organizations-- because such systems have the ability to *sustain, regulate and repair* their decision-making agency within contexts with widely *variable* [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md).
