Agency is a compound, emergent personal property with three constituent properties: the ability, capacity and opportunity (i.el, lack of stifling coercion) to make meaningful decisions between possible action or non-action within a personal or social context.   

Agency is normally associated with opportunities which do not significantly diminish oneâ€™s future agency within the described context.  For instance, sustainable systems often require persistent human roles.

Agency is exclusively a property of (some, but not all) complexly adaptive systems-- including organisms, social groups and organizations-- because such systems have the ability to regulate, sustain and repair their decision-making agency in varied conditions.
