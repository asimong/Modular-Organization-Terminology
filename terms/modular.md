Modular [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md) works by connecting [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which perform [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) within [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  
 
The specifications of modules *must* indicate *required* [properties](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/property.md), enabling the independent development of divergent designs.  

Crucially, the (explicitly or implicitly defined) *interfaces* of modules enable them to be removed and replaced by other components which match their required specifications.
 
People often reserve the use of “modular” specifically for *physical* [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) and, by extension, the design of systems of modular tools.  However, agents often (either consciously or unconsciously) use at least somewhat modular creative techniques pursuit of complex [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md).
