Modular [technology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md) works by connecting [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which perform *[specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* within [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  
 
The specifications of modules *must* indicate [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md), enabling the independent [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) of *divergent* [designs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md).  

Crucially, the (explicitly or implicitly defined) *interfaces* of modules enable them to be *removed and replaced* by other components which match their required specifications.
 
[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often reserve the use of “modular” *strictly* for [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) and, by extension, the design of systems of modular physical tools.  However, modular design is common in software [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/development.md).  Also, agents often use at least somewhat modular *developmental [techniques](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technique.md)* to pursue [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) in many *disciplines*, even when [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) are not [offered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/offer.md) in modular [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).
